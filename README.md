# 🛡️ CyberTalents Network Security Write-ups  
### By Sherif Osman

This repository contains my write-ups for **Network Security challenges** from the **CyberTalents platform**.  
These challenges focus on **packet analysis, traffic investigation, and network forensics techniques** used in real-world security operations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

Through these challenges, I practiced and demonstrated skills in:

- PCAP traffic analysis  
- Network forensics  
- Detecting suspicious and malicious communication  
- Data exfiltration techniques  
- Protocol inspection (HTTP, DNS, TCP, etc.)  

This repository is part of my journey toward becoming a **SOC Analyst / Blue Team Specialist**.
